"""The camera contract: what the assistant asks of whatever owns cameras — Arlo and Ring today,
a local NVR such as UniFi Protect tomorrow. A provider is always an Integration too (name, config
keys, health); `fetch_camera_images` fans out over every enabled and configured one through
`active()` and never names a folder. The result shape is the LLM's: Anthropic content blocks, an
image block followed by a "Camera: <name>" text block per camera, a text block for a camera that
failed, nothing else — the one header line over all providers is the command's."""
