"""The car contract: what the assistant asks of whatever brand's cloud the family's cars talk
to — Tesla through Tessie today, Volvo, Polestar or BMW tomorrow. A provider is always an
Integration too (name, config keys, health); the `cars` toolkit's commands and the CURRENT CAR
INFO prompt section run against the `Fleet` over every enabled and configured provider and
never name a folder. The LLM speaks `vehicle_id`s — the `name` of a car's config entry — and
the fleet resolves one to its provider and the provider's own handle for the car (a VIN, an
API id), so brands merge into one list of cars in the prompt.

Every action returns a line for the LLM ("Trunk opened for Family Model Y.") or raises a
VehicleError; the command decides whether the line is worth saying. A brand without an action
leaves the default in place, which raises Unsupported — the LLM hears that the car cannot do it
instead of a stack trace."""
