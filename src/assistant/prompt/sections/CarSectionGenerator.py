"""The CURRENT CAR INFO section: one line per car of every ready VehicleProvider — Tesla
beside whatever other brand the house has — with the car's vehicle_id, whether it is parked or
driving, where it is (Home, or an address), its route or how far from home it is, the cabin
temperature, the charge and the range — rounded and held (Held.py), so a parked or charging
car's line stays the same text for hours and the prompt's cache with it. Refreshed every five minutes while every car is parked and every
minute while one is driving; a parked car's minutes from home are asked for every ten minutes
and held through a one-minute traffic wobble; a brand that fails gets an error on its car's
line and the others stay. Without a ready provider the section is the setup hint."""
