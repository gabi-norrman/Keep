"""memory/procedures/ — the how-tos the assistant has learnt, one markdown file per procedure.

A procedure is a sequence that worked: how to log in somewhere, how to pay, how to read the
pool display. Every step and literal matters, so a procedure is never condensed: the prompt
carries only an index line per file (built here from the file, so nobody can erode it) and the
`load_procedure` command loads the body when it is needed. `save_procedure` replaces a whole
procedure and `delete_procedure` removes one; a replaced or deleted version is copied to
`log/memory/procedures/` first, which is a debugging trail the LLM never reads. The memory
curator alone appends dated notes (`procedure_note`): it may add to a procedure, never rewrite it.

The commands and the memory curator's command block both go through `run`; the curator is not
allowed to replace or delete (`allow_replace=False`).
