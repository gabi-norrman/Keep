"""
Notifier — the assistant's outbound side channel to the user.

The core (commands, agents, integrations) needs to push things at the user outside a
dialog turn: 2FA prompts, autonomous findings, photos, bug reports, and the approve/deny
gate for sensitive commands. Which chat app renders those is an interface concern, so the
core talks to whatever `set_notifier()` installed and never imports `interfaces.*`.

Default is `NullNotifier`: everything is logged and dropped, and `request_approval`
answers "unavailable" — a missing notifier must never let a sensitive command through.
