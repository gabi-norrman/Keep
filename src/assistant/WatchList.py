"""memory/watchlist/ — everything the assistant is keeping an eye on, one small file per open item.

An item is something with a state that will change or end: an order on its way, an invoice to
pay, an appointment, an open decision, a reminder. It answers to its name, like a procedure
does. Its note is the item's *current* state and is replaced when the item is saved again, so
an item lives in one place instead of as a trail of remembered sentences. Deleting an item
removes its file; every replaced or deleted version is copied to `log/memory/watchlist/`
first, which is a debugging trail the LLM never reads.

An item may carry a due date, which may name a time (`due`: "2026-11-08" or "2026-11-08 17:00");
a due *time* is a moment the assistant acts at — `due_moment` reads it, and the item is due for a poll
from then until it is looked at again (checked, re-dated or deleted), so a reminder the check
failed to deliver comes back on the next one instead of being lost; a bare date fires nothing.
An item may carry a check cadence (`every`: "1d", "6h", "weekly" — free text the LLM reads)
and always carries when it was last looked at (`checked`, with the time of day): `updated`
moves when the state changes, `checked` whenever someone looks (the assistant's `save_watch` is a
look; the curator's nightly rewrite is not). A check that finds nothing
stamps `checked` with `checked_watch` and leaves the note alone, so the note never turns into
a trail again. `interval` and `stamp` read the cadence and the stamp: `due_for_poll` is the
code's arithmetic on the two (the autonomous check gets only the items it names in full, which
keeps that prompt small; it passes half its own interval as the tolerance, so an item is polled
by the check that falls nearest its cadence), `pending` the moments the manager's due watcher wakes
for, and the TUI draws when the next check falls from them.

The `save_watch`, `checked_watch` and `delete_watch` commands and the memory curator's command
block all go through `run`. The prompt's watch-list section is only an index (`render_index`: a
line per item); `load_watch` returns whole items (`load`); the curator, which works through the
whole list, gets `render`, and the autonomous check `render_due` — the items whose poll is due.
The TUI's Watch list tab draws the items themselves (`items`).
