"""The active command format with the other models' native blocks read beside it, so a call the model writes in its own trained shape under another syntax still runs.

Opus 5.5 writes a `<function_calls>` / `<invoke>` block now and then whatever syntax the
prompt teaches: four of 428 replies under Keep's syntax on the production server between
2026-10-18 and -21, each a whole, correct block and nothing else (Fable never did it once).
DeepSeek V4.1 Flash did the same with its DSML block on the ds4 host on 2026-11-07: five
replies in a row under Keep's syntax, each a DSML block, and not one call ran. Keep's parser
saw no call in them, so the raw block reached the chat, and the stored turn then showed the
model its own block on every later prompt — the loop that makes the drift recur. This format
wraps the active one: a buffer is read by whichever syntax opens a call first in it, the
active one or one of the rescues (`RESCUES`: Claude's invoke block, DeepSeek's DSML block),
a call a rescue read is logged at NOTE level and runs like any other, and `rewritten` writes
every such block back in the active syntax (its `render_tool_call`, the way `OllamaLLM`
writes a server-parsed call) before the turn is stored, so the history holds nothing but the
syntax the prompt teaches. A format that is itself one of the rescues keeps the others beside
it (the invoke format reads DSML as its rescue, the DSML format the invoke block); the fused spelling Opus wrote once (`<invoke_load_toolkit>`, 2026-10-22) and the DSML
slips of 2026-11-07 are each the rescue's own to read and are rescued the same way.
