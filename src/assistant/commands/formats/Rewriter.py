"""Renders the command calls of a prompt text in the active command format, leaving everything else as written.

The texts (`res/prompt.md`, the toolkits) are written in Keep's syntax; `rewrite` finds every
backticked `name(...)` whose name is in the signature table and replaces it with the format's
rendering — `render_declaration` for a declaration, `render_example` for an example, whose
values are paired with the declared names in order. The texts follow one convention
(docs/plans/FORMAT_NEUTRAL_TEXTS_PLAN.md): a mention is the bare name, which stays as written;
`name()` is the declaration of a parameterless command and renders as one, never as a call
block. `name()` of a command that has parameters, a `word(x)` that is no command and a call the
canon cannot read are left as written rather than guessed at (a unit test forbids the first in
the texts). A passage between `<!-- keep -->` and `<!-- /keep -->` lines is prose only Keep's
syntax needs: the Keep format keeps the passage and drops the markers, every other format drops
the passage. For the Keep format the call rewrite is the identity.
