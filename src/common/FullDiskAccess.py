"""Full Disk Access, the one macOS grant the first-time setup needs the user to make at the Mac
itself: the probe for it and the System Settings pane it is made in.

macOS grants Full Disk Access to the app it holds responsible for the server, which is Terminal
(start.sh launches the server through it, cli_start.sh). The probe is whether this process may
read chat.db, the Messages database the grant guards — the same test the iMessage integration's
health check makes. A grant applies only to a relaunched Terminal: macOS offers to quit it when
the toggle goes on, and the server, which has left the Terminal window's session, survives that
and is then restarted (`restart_server`) so the new process runs with the grant.

A developer's Mac has the grant already, so the grant step could never be tested there:
`pretend_missing()` makes this process report the grant missing (FirstRun calls it on a fresh
install when `is_developer` is on). The restart the step ends with starts a process that probes
for real, exactly as a beta install's does.
