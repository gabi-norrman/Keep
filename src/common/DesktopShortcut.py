"""The Keep.app shortcut on the Desktop, an AppleScript applet that runs `keep.sh`, built once
the first-time setup sees Full Disk Access granted (`common/FullDiskAccess`).

`keep.sh` opens a terminal (Ghostty, else iTerm2, else Terminal) and attaches the console to
the running server, or starts the server first; the applet only runs that script, so the server
is still launched by start.sh through Terminal and the Mac's grants keep applying to it.
