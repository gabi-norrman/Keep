"""The default browser of the machine the server runs on, opened on a URL for the console's user.

A terminal makes a wrapped link clickable only when it honours OSC 8 hyperlinks; Terminal.app
does not, and its own URL detection stops at the row's end, so the console opens the link
itself on the key — on the server's Mac, which is where the TUI's user sits everywhere but
over `tui.py <host>`, and where an OAuth redirect to localhost has to land anyway.
