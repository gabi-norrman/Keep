# Prepending the user query to the TOP of the system prompt nudges accuracy up, but it puts
# per-request content at byte 0 of the cached prefix — so no request reads what the previous
# one cached: every request writes the whole prefix anew and only its own command follow-up
# rounds read it (ClaudeLLM then caches every block at its 5m tier, set_per_request_prefix;
# the autonomous check never prepends and keeps its 1h blocks). That balloons Anthropic
# costs/latency. It also wrecks local Gemma, where a stable KV-cache prefix is critical.
#
# Whether to prepend is now decided PER LLM via AbstractLLM.prefers_prepended_user_query():
# the base default is ON (prepend), and the LLMs that pay a caching/KV penalty opt out
# (Claude on Fable models, where Anthropic cache economics bite hardest; Ollama, which
# needs a stable KV-cache prefix. Older Claude models keep the accuracy nudge).

# Two global OVERRIDES of those per-LLM defaults, each a tri-state, the env var over the
# config key (prepend_user_query_override):

#   FLOXY_PREPEND_USER_QUERY=0 -> False -> force OFF for every LLM
#   FLOXY_PREPEND_USER_QUERY=1 -> True  -> force ON for every LLM (the prompt test runner's A/B knob)
# and the root config.yaml key `prepend_user_query`: auto (the default) / true / false, read at
# each request so a config_set is in force from the next request on.

# row, the query header timestamped, and none of the per-request extras the next turn drops
# (<thinking> instruction, language and brevity directives). FLOXY_BYTE_PREFIX_TAIL=0 turns
# it off for an A/B run.

# the untouched transient notes and the frozen eviction stub are for (ClaudeLLM._message_cache_index,

# because the window was edited between calls and the 2x writes never got their read.
# Only a request's first round writes at this TTL: a follow-up round's tail is read by the next
# round seconds later and by nothing after, so it takes ClaudeLLM.FOLLOW_UP_CACHE_TTL (5m).
