    """Keep improving its own code with Claude Code, nightly and on request.

    Lets Keep analyse and improve its own code through the Claude Code CLI: the nightly
    code-quality runs and the self_analysis / self_improvement commands. It needs only the CLI
    installed on the server machine; the runs use api_keys.anthropic unless a claude.ai login
    is there.

    The switch and the health check: the runs (CodeQualityMaintainer) happen only while this
    integration is enabled, the nightly ones also only while `self_improvement.nightly_runs` is
    on. The setup is in the config.example.yaml beside this file, section self_improvement. The
    health check asks `claude auth status`, a free local call, so a missing CLI or one without
    credentials shows in list_integrations within a cycle. A login takes precedence over the key
    (the key is only handed to the CLI when there is no login, since the environment variable
    would shadow a login and move its billing to the key)."""
