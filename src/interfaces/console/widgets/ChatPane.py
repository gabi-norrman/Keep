"""The Codex-style chat pane on the Home tab: a transcript of `•` bullets above a `›`
composer framed by two thin rules, with a dim footer of key hints.

The pane is the screen side of `ConsoleTransport`: the transport (called from ChatSession
worker threads) writes entries into the model here, and the TUI loop draws them. The model
is guarded by a lock; an entry's text lives in a `TypewriterText`, and only what the assistant
emits — its replies and its thinking — reveals with the CRT sweep; everything else (the user's
turns, command echoes, media labels, prompts, history) shows up at once. A photo (or a video's
poster frame) the assistant sends is drawn in the transcript — `IMAGE_ROWS` of the pane's height,
fitted to the picture's proportions — with its caption under it (`TUIScreen.image`: the
terminal's graphics protocol where it has one, half-block pixels where not), and scrolls with
the text a row at a time. `HistoryFeed` fills the same transcript with the
day's dialog history — other channels' turns, system events — inserted by timestamp and
shown at once, each under a dim header saying who and when. Assistant, notice and system
entries hold the chat HTML subset; user text is plain; a diff entry is a `-`/`+` listing.
Vaulted values are masked the way the Vault tab lists them (`•••• 1234`) as an entry is laid
out — every kind, streaming replies included — and the masks are marked in orange, as in the
Memory tab. A value still arriving in a streaming chunk is masked once it is whole.

Keys: printable text edits the composer (`LineEditor`), Enter sends, Shift+Enter (or Alt+Enter,
for a terminal that cannot tell Shift+Enter from Enter) breaks a line, ↑/↓ scroll the transcript
(a line at a time, as in every other tab), PgUp/PgDn browse the composer's history — only the
entries containing what is typed, so "//feed" + PgUp recalls the last //feed command — Esc
interrupts a running reply or clears the composer. A picture pasted with Ctrl+V (the Home tab
reads the clipboard and calls `attach_image`) is staged above the text as a thumbnail
(`THUMBNAIL_ROWS` high, the staged pictures side by side) with its chip under it —
`[image 1: 1200×800, 340 kB]` — until Enter sends it with the text as its caption
(`on_submit(text, images)`) or Esc drops it; a pane too short for thumbnails shows the chips
alone on one row. The sent turn shows the picture under the `›` with the text as its caption,
as the assistant's photos show theirs.
While an approval prompt is pending the pane is modal: y approves, n or Esc denies. While a
secret prompt is pending the composer becomes a masked field of its own (a history-less
`LineEditor`, so the value never reaches tui_state.json): Enter hands the value on, Tab
reveals it, Esc cancels; the value is never added to the transcript.
