    Call update(x, y) once per frame with the current cursor position; whenever
    the position changes the previous cell is recorded as a trail point with a
    timestamp. draw() then renders the trail (fading from the cursor color toward
    black over TRAIL_DURATION) and the current cursor head on top.

    The trail re-paints the character currently on screen at each trail cell
    (looked up via the optional `char_at` callback) so typed characters remain
    visible on the colored background instead of being wiped to a blank space.

    The cursor color defaults to BRIGHT (green) but matches the caller's `fg`
    when supplied, so the trail blends with the surrounding text color.

    All methods must be called from a single thread (the TUI animation loop).
