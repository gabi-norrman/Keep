"""The startup intro of the TUI (`plans/STARTUP_INTRO_PLAN.md`): once the server's curtains
have closed over the first client's terminal, the Crystal `Scene` plays its flight over the
whole screen — no tab bar, no tab — until the object has settled as the logo. The logo then
holds on the black screen while the title (`Title`) types out to its right with the CRT
cursor, and after a short hold the tabs draw as usual, the Home tab keeping the logo and
the title where they are and the chat starting under the logo, until the transcript fills
and scrolls them up and away. Any key skips to the end of whatever is playing. Later clients of the same process get the tabs straight away."""
