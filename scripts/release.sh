# Publishes master as the release: fast-forwards origin's `release` branch to master's tip
# and tags the commit with its version (the vYYYY.MM.N of common/Version.py). Installs track

#                           leave these released commits out of the what's new (a change
#                           the household should not be told about, or one a later commit
#                           undid); the commits are released all the same
#   scripts/release.sh [<commit>] <guidance for the note…>
#                           any words that are not a commit go to Claude as guidance for the
#                           what's new, e.g. `scripts/release.sh dont talk about icloud accounts
#                           being blocked`
#
# Before tagging, Claude Code (`claude -p`) reads the released commits and writes a "what's
# new" for the household, which becomes the body of the annotated tag. An install's pull
# brings the tag along with the commit, and the server's first start on it announces the
# note (common/StartupTracker.py reads it through Version.release_notes()). A missing
# `claude` or a failed run leaves the tag without a note and never fails the release.
#
# The tag is signed (`git tag -s`, the SSH key `user.signingkey` names — the maintainer's, held in
# 1Password) and verified before the push against res/release_signers as the current release has
# it: installs move to a release only when its tag verifies against the signers file of the code
# they already run (common/SignedRelease.py), so a push to `release` without that key reaches no one.
#
# The commits listed and summarised reach back to the last release tagged on an earlier day,
# not merely to the previous release: installs update nightly, so a household that gets the
# evening release never saw the midday one, and its note has to cover the whole day.

Run \`git show <hash>\` or \`git show --stat <hash>\` when a message does not make the user-facing effect clear.$left_out

Create a user friendly, punchy and nice \"what's new\" for this release. Format it so that it will look nice
in a Telegram chat: the bot sends HTML, so use <b>…</b> and <i>…</i> only, blank lines between items, an emoji
or two where it helps, nothing else (no markdown, no headers, no code spans, no tables). Do not open with a
title or the version: the message that carries the note already says which release it is.

The readers are not developers. Describe what they will notice — what Keep can now do, what got better, what
was fixed and why — never how it was built. Leave out refactors, tests, tooling, docs and anything with no visible
effect (if appropriate add a line about general performance/bug/stability fixes); if nothing visible changed, say so
in one friendly line. Group related commits into one item. Output only the note, nothing before or after it.$guided
