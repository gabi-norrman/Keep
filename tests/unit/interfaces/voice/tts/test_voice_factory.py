The factory speaks through the first engine in `engine_order` that is enabled in
`enabled_integrations` and has its config keys (ElevenLabs is on by default, Swedish prefers
Gemini); with none it returns None and the request runs text-only. The conftest stubs
`Integration.enabled` to True for every class, so the tests here decide per engine."""
