"""The post-call hold of the command processor: on a backend whose model may resume reasoning
in the content stream after a call (`AbstractLLM.resumes_thinking_after_calls`, ds4), the
text after a dispatched call is held back until a bare </think> shows it was reasoning —
dropped, and never parsed for calls — or the stream ends and it was the reply.

Prod 2026-11-08 23:10: a Telegram reply began with the model's reasoning ("Keep reply short,
in English … Yes, briefly — it's money.</think>Good — so the Frame goes back tomorrow"), and
at 23:12 the reasoning repeated the call it followed, so the command ran twice."""
